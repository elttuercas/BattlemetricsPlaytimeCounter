#### BM+ Additions:

+ Rust Game Ban - a link that leads to a webpage where you can check if the user is EAC banned.
+ Rust BM playtime - view total playtime by this user on Rust servers that Battlemetrics has access to.
+ Aim train playtime - view total playtime by this user on Rust servers that Battlemetrics has access to and have either "ukn" or "aim" in their name.
+ Rust servers played - view total servers joined by this user on Rust servers that Battlemetrics has access to.

Please note that these numbers may be inaccurate. This only tracks the servers that Battlemetrics has access to. All of the hours equal to the sum of the hours that the user has played on Rust on their "public profile" button on the top right of the RCON profile. Rust BM playtime may significantly differ from actual playtime on the Steam webpage but it still is a good estimate of how many hours played are real.

You are free to use and modify this code. If you like you can also submit a pull request and I'll most likely accept it. The code might not be the best thing and uses a bunch of hacky things to inject onto the page but it hey, at least it works :P
